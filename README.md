# Thesis project

This application implements a marching-cubes algorithm and a boids algorithm to procedurally generate underwater terrain and to simulate flocking behaviour.

## This is a video demonstration of the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtUVZzep6wo

This also contains shaders which are used to simulate underwater distortion and fog.
The game can be played using a VR headset, but there are also some disabled cameras which allow the user to play the game with a mouse and a keyboard.

There are 4 scenes for this app: Exploration ('swimming' around, watching fish and procedurally generated terrain), Terrain Analysis (Changing parameters to see how the terrain is generated), Boid Analysis (Changing parameters to see how the boids behave and also controlling their direction using a target) and finally a VR test room (allows the user to test the VR capabilities by throwing around cubes)
